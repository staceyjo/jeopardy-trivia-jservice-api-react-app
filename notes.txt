What is Create React App?

1. An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs such as XMLHttpRequest and Fetch when different content is to be shown.

This therefore allows users to use websites without loading whole new pages from the server, which can result in performance gains and a more dynamic experience, with some tradeoff disadvantages such as SEO, more effort required to maintain state, implement navigation, and do meaningful performance monitoring.
2. React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook. React is a User Interface (UI) library. React is a User Interface (UI) library. React is focused on creating declarative user interfaces (UIs) using a component-based concept. It’s used for handling the view layer and can be used for web and mobile apps. React’s main goal is to be extensive, fast,  declarative, flexible, and simple.
3. JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React. JSX is a JavaScript extension where we can embed valid JavaScript objects into HTML elements. JSX makes Code easier to read and understand. Usually, HTML and JavaScript is written separately but react creates components that contain both HTML and JavaScript. JSX is a React extension to the JavaScript language syntax which provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. It is similar in appearance to HTML.
4. Babel is a JavaScript compiler. Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Babel is a very famous transpiler that basically allows us to use future JavaScript in today's browsers. In simple words, it can convert the latest version of JavaScript code into the one that the browser understands. javascript code and jsx and translating it into older browser readable javascript. This allows us to use the newest javascript in React with out concern for browser compatibility.
5. Webpack is a free and open-source module bundler for JavaScript. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser
6. Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React. It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. Whether you're using React or another library, Create React App lets you focus on code, not build tools. create-react-app (CRA)
When it comes to using the major frontend frameworks (Angular, React, Vue, and Svelte) to really create the ideal development environment it can take several different tools.
bundler A bundler takes all our code across several javascript files, runs it through several plugins (like babel and eslint) then takes all the code and builds it into one javascript file for deployment. The two major bundlers are Webpack and Rollup, with Parcel and Snowpack being newcomers growing in popularity.
It would not be pleasant to have to configure all of the above for every React app you want to create so there is a vast array of project generators out there for all the frameworks that give you pre-configured templates to start from.
